It is called the "Vanguard of Freedom". Naguey is one of the 7 barangays of the Municipality of Atok. It is one of the far flung places of atok that hides a unique treasure of beauty. Its mountainous location gives an extra challenge for the residents aside from the heavy work in the rice fields and gardens. The land was cultivated and planted by the old people long ago but later on terrraced and planted with rice seedlings.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Tiotio 2018, Naguey was named after a plant they call "naguey" in the olden days. In those days, people in the place are getting "naguey" and there they called it "man nagnaguey". It was later shortened to "naguey" and became the name of the said place.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On of the prides of the place is its great "palayan" or rice terraces. Aside from rice grains, the people also planted sweet potatoes, cassava, "pako" (fern-like edible plant that serves as viand) and taro among others. In the place, there are also coconuts, bananas, star apples, and pineapples. These grew richly in the place because of its hot weather. Moreover, rice terraces exist due to sufficient water supply. Among these, hospitable and kind people also reside in the place.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Thirst for more?Come and visit!</em><br></p></div>
